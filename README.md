# Lab Work 5: Battleship Game Bot (Console Application)

This lab focuses on designing and implementing a console-based **battleship bot** that communicates via standard input and output streams. The bot supports two roles ‚Äî `master` and `slave` ‚Äî and follows the rules of the classic [Battleship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) with extended flexibility.

---

## üéØ Objective

Create a command-line program that:
- Implements both **master** and **slave** player roles
- Allows customizable game parameters (field size, number of ships)
- Interacts using a set of predefined **text commands**
- Supports **strategic gameplay** with interchangeable algorithms
- Separates game logic from input/output handling
- Can be tested automatically and used in bot-vs-bot tournaments

---

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Overview

- The game starts when the `master` sets up the field and sends parameters to the `slave`.
- Both players place ships and take turns firing.
- Communication is **command-based** via stdin/stdout.
- The `slave` always fires first.

Field size and number of ships can be changed before the game starts. Ships must conform to standard sizes (1, 2, 3, and 4 cells).

## üßæ Dump / Load File Format
WIDTH HEIGHT SIZE DIRECTION X Y ...


- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Field dimensions
- Each ship:
  - `SIZE`: Length of the ship (1‚Äì4)
  - `DIRECTION`: `h` (horizontal) or `v` (vertical)
  - `X`, `Y`: Top-left coordinates

### Example:
`10 10 1 v 0 0 2 h 3 4 4 h 1 8`

---

## üß† Strategies

Your bot must implement at least two strategies:

- **Ordered** ‚Äî Fires from (0,0) row by row (used for testing)
- **Custom** ‚Äî Your unique strategy (used by default)

You can implement more strategies and allow switching via command.

---

## üìå Requirements

- Only one `master` and one `slave` per game
- Cannot start the game until field size and ship counts are valid
- Cannot change field or ship counts after the game starts
- Coordinates are 0-based, with (0,0) being the top-left
- `get shot` must be followed by `set result` before the next move
- Strategy can be changed mid-game
- `load` can override setup (before game start)

---

## üí° Implementation Notes

- The program must run as either a `master` or `slave` per launch
- All interaction is through **stdin** and **stdout**
- Organize code using proper abstractions (input/output, game logic, strategies)
- Writing unit tests is encouraged
- Pay attention to architecture ‚Äî it will be evaluated

---

## üèÜ Bonus: Tournament Mode

After the final deadline, a tournament will be held with bots competing within each group.

**Rules:**
- Each pair plays 2 games (roles swapped)
- Win both: 3 points; draw: 1; lose: 0
- Invalid commands, crashes, or rule violations = automatic loss
- `slave` fires first
- `master` must survive until game ends
- Top 5 players get bonus points (1st = +5, 5th = +1)

**Memory limit:** 64 MB
